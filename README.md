## Description
PenPal is an interactive Rails web application built from conception to completion that authenticates with a third-party service (Google), consumes multiple APIs (Spotify and Pexel), and provides a solution to an identified problem.

PenPal is intended to support users in times when they are feeling down, unmotivated or alone. Interacting with the app, users are asked to complete a personal survey, after which they can record their current mood and receive a catered suggestion based on their stated preferences. Identified close friends are sent an introductory email notifying them that the user may occasionally connect with them. Suggestions from PenPal include a specific activity, song, image, a friend's contact information, or place to journal. Eventually, the app will have the ability to track moods and activities to help users learn more about themselves.
